		<p>A Million Miles Away is an album by MACROSS-8299. It was released on May 7, 2014 under the label Neoncity Records. MACROSS-8299 is an artists who focuses on the genres Vaporwave and Future Funk. 
		These genres are considered to be somewhat underground and are not necessarily recognized by the greater music community. Personally it is in my top 5 albums of all time. If I were to reccomend the genres to someone this would be the first one I would reccomend.</p>
